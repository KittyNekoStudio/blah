# What is blah?

blah is a gui text editor made in Java.

[Roadmap](/docs/blah-roadmap.md)

## What does blah aim to do?

blah is here solely to become my main computing environment. I plan to make it
replace everything besides a browser for me. There is no plans on filling the 
needs of anyone but mine.

## What technology will blah use?

blah will be made with Java and JavaFX.

## What features will blah have?

blah is meant to be a replacement for all software I use, which is not much. I
mainly live in the terminal and browser. So blah will be a terminal emulator
with it's interface being a text editor. Like how [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
is a text editor but it's core is an elisp interpreter, allowing you to run
whatever elisp programs you want. I want blah to be that but with using a shell
instead of an interpreter.

blah plans to have:

* A fully featured text editor
* Interaction with a shell to run any program you want
* A robust plugin system to extend blah however you want

## Who is this for?

This is for me. I am creating this for my use and no one else. Because of this 
I won't be accepting any contributions. This does have the MIT license, so you 
can fork it however you like, just don't expect it to be pulled upstream.

## Contributing

You're funny. This is made by me for me. Fork it if you want to work on it.
